i18n workflow

Structure
- lib/i18n/en/*.ts and lib/i18n/am/*.ts hold domain modules
- lib/i18n/en/index.ts and lib/i18n/am/index.ts aggregate domain keys
- lib/i18n/index.ts exports `translations`, `Language`, `TranslationKey`

Conventions
- English is the reference for keys (camelCase)
- Amharic must have 1:1 keys with English
- Use `useLanguage().t(key)` in UI; avoid hardcoded strings

Adding new strings
1. Add key to the relevant en domain file
2. Mirror the key in the corresponding am domain file
3. Ensure exports are included in each language index
4. Run the parity check

Parity check
- Run: `npm run i18n:check`
- Fails if am is missing keys or has extras vs en

Default language
- Default is Amharic; user choice persists in localStorage
- HTML `lang` updates dynamically via `LanguageProvider`
